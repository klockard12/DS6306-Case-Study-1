# DS6306-Case-Study-1


Case Study 1 - Katherine Lockard and Eli Kravez

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between IBU and ABV of beers and then determine if these values vary by state. Using this information, we provided useful new product reccomendations to Budweiser.

This repo contains the following files: Beers.csv, Breweries.csv, FinalPres1.ppt, DDS_Vers6.1.RMD, and DDS_Vers6.1.html.

The powerpoint is contained in the zip file. The file size was too large and needed to be compressed in order to upload it to the repository.
