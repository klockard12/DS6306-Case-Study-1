# DS6306-Case-Study-1


Case Study 1 - Katherine Lockard and Eli Kravez

The goal of this project is to determine if there is a relationship between IBU and ABV of beers and if these values vary by state. Using this information, we provided useful new product reccomendations to Budweiser.

This repo contains the following files: Beers.csv, Breweries.csv, FinalPres1.ppt, DDS_Vers6.1.RMD, and DDS_Vers6.1.html.
